<h2><a name="standparams"></a>Understanding the Standard Parameter Set That is Used in Many Command Comments</h2>
<div>
The standard parameter set is used to set obfuscation encoding parameters for object types or for a specific list: 

<br><br><font color="brown">{minobfstr}, {maxobfstr}, {obfrows}, {fragsperrow}, {minfragstr}, {maxfragstr}</font>

<br><br>Whenever these are allowed in a statement, each individual parameter is optional and you can just leave out the ones you do not want to change. Do however put commas in as placeholders up to the values you want to change.

<br><br>The first 2 parameters specify the minimum size and the maximum size of newly created obfuscated object names. At obfuscation time, a number within this range will be randomly chosen as the the length of each new name. If you do not change your program but just rerun the obfuscation function, the same objects will have different obfuscation strings with different lengths. Obfuscating the exact same program twice will result in a program that looks almost completely different!

<br><br>If you want to turn off obfuscation for something, use -1 as the first parameter and then leave off all the other parameters.

<br><br>The 3rd and 4th parameters specify how many rows and columns of dynamic obfuscation you want for each individual object. These will cause object names to be made out of fragments that will be represented by the presence of %'s in object names. You can specify as many rows as you want but you can only have up to 2 columns. 

<br><br>For each cell in the dynamic obfuscation table, a new obfuscated string will be created and set to part or all of the 'straight' obfuscated string for that object. At obfuscation time, a random row will be chosen in the table in order to obfuscate the current usage of the object that is found. This means that 20 usages of the same function within your program can come out all looking completely different! If you want to turn off dynamic obfuscation and use straight obfuscation only, use a -1 in the 3rd parameter and leave off the rest of the parameters after that.

<br><br>The 5th and 6th parameters are similar to the 1st and 2nd parameters in that they specify the minimum size and the maximum size for newly obfuscated strings that will be part of the dynamic obfuscation object name fragments table. A length within this range will be randomly chosen at obfuscation time.
